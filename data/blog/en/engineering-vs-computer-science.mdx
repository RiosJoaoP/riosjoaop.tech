# Introduction

As a **Computer Engineering** student at the Federal University of Bahia (UFBA) since 2019, I have had various opportunities to explore the world of **Computer Science**. Whether through shared courses, conversations with colleagues, or experiences during my time at the **Junior Enterprise** (a topic I will cover more thoroughly in a future post).

Choosing between Engineering and Computer Science is a common decision for students and professionals seeking a solid **career** in **technology and innovation**. Although both fields share essential foundations such as **logic**, **problem-solving**, and **technical expertise**, each follows a distinct path in terms of **academic training**, **market opportunities**, and the **skills required**. In this article, I will share a bit of my experience and provide an overview of what each path can offer. I hope you enjoy it!

### Computing for the Scientist

For the computer scientist, **computing** is more than just a tool – it is the **object of study** itself. The goal is to deeply understand how systems work, from **theory to implementation**. These professionals use computing to **model**, **analyze**, and **solve complex problems**, developing new techniques, algorithms, and solutions that drive **technological innovation** and the continuous progress of the field.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What does a computer engineer do in the job market?

Computer Engineers develop systems that integrate hardware and software, such as **embedded devices**, **industrial automation**, and **IoT solutions** (Internet of Things). They typically work in multidisciplinary teams in sectors like telecommunications, automation, and information technology.

### And what about the computer scientist?

Computer scientists are responsible for developing **algorithms**, **software**, and **information systems**. They can work in areas such as artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, data analysis, and software development, seeking innovations and improvements in computational processes.

### How to choose between the two fields?

The choice should be based on personal interests and career goals. If you are more interested in hardware, electronics, and integrated systems, Computer Engineering might be the better choice. If you prefer programming, algorithms, and computing theory, Computer Science might be more suitable.

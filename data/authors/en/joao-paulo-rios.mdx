Hello, I'm **João Paulo Rios**, a passionate enthusiast of technology and automation! I'm about to graduate in **Computer Engineering** and have been diving headfirst into the world of **IoT** and **Embedded Systems**. I love exploring how we can creatively and efficiently connect the physical world to the digital realm.

In addition to **IoT**, I'm fascinated by **Residential and Industrial Automation**, always seeking new ways to make our environments smarter. I have strong programming skills in **Web Development** and **Mobile**, and I also have knowledge in **Machine Learning** and **Artificial Intelligence**. I'm always ready to tackle new challenges and learn something new. Let's explore the endless possibilities of technology together and create a more connected and innovative future!

I conclude with the words of **Tony Stark**:

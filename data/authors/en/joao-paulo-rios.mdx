João Paulo Rios is a computer engineering student and data scientist at the Federal University of Bahia. His research interests includes Machine Learning and Industrial Processes Optimization.

His current research aims to reduce injection mold costs by employing steel insert gates - a permanent component - with inserts manufactured through additive manufacturing using low-cost materials, and inserts through machining of low-cost metallic alloy (e.g., Aluminum, ZAMAC, etc.) - a replaceable component.

Beyond the classroom and laboratory, he loves practicing Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, hanging out with friends an playing some video games.
